                    This is a space for anyone who identifies as Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA) to share their stories and voice–to talk about your triumphs, your struggles, what makes you you, what makes up your world. Even if you don’t identify as APIDA, you are always welcome here; we are an inclusive space striving to uplift marginalized communities through creativity, education, and meaningful discussion.

I submitted one prose piece detailing my struggles growing up Asian American, and pretty soon, found myself as a writer on a full-fledged literature staff.

                    I was inspired by the family of passionate individuals working with me who, no matter which background, were dedicated to sharing their stories, celebrating each other, and educating the world on important matters surrounding social justice and civic engagement. When Dear Asian Youth finally became a registered nonprofit and started opening community and school chapters around the globe I knew I wanted to bring a similar space to USC…

I hope you’ll stay around, and whether you decide to join our rapidly growing family or simply want to look around, I hope you’ll take with you the same amount of joy and growth from the pieces by our talented writers and illustrators as I do.
