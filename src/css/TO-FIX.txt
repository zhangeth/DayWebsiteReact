sorry to clog i'll delete this later

I don't think getting page-load done by this week is feasible,
I have plans for statically formatting the home page which will
need a lot of reformatting.

REFERENCE MATERIAL
The New Yorker:
    - images load in all at once after the format is already in place
        - should be doable with JS properties: document.querySelector()
        - don't know how to format when we don't really have any html files..
Benjamin Nespoulous personal web:
    - creates a div that covers the screen (z-layer higher)
    - div slides off screen (likely just height transition function)
        - GUESSES:
            - position on screen absolute
            - width = 100%, height = 100%
            - default ease out transition

    - he starts some text positioned at 270deg and transitions the
    rotation to go 90deg counterclockwise
        - OK ITS NOT 270 JUST SLIGHTLY OFF KILTER
        - the text seems to be hidden in like a window, its like
        how images fill into a gallery
        - experiment with inline-block display or other display formats
        
        |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
        <div class="text-wrapper">
            <p class="rotated-text"> </p>
        </div>
        |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
        .text-wrapper{
            display: inline-block
        }
        .text-wrapper > .rotated-text{
            [CSS attributes]
        }
        |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

    - after "sliding" it should disappear
        -visibility: invisible
            -check itp303 notes
        -POINT IS SHOULD BE DOABLE!!
            - Design plan: boba color
            - I think it would be cool for the letters to fall into place
                -bob up and down, then come up with the sliding div

TODO
On Load:
    - fonts go crazy, i don't know what 'font': pv3, and 'font': h6v4 are supposed to do
        -should be NewEditorialLight on load but seems to be thicker version initially
        -AT LEAST import all fonts to the CSS sheet

    - images don't load in full size on load
        -want to make the cards statically sized and images stretch to fill them.
        -this should help w/adaptability for new content

    - when you zoom out screen, the images don't stretch to fill the column and they aren't
    centered so it doesn't look the best
        -would be solved by statically sized imgBox CSS implementation

Other:
    - the fonts look blurry even after load, looks like a text-shadow but unintentional
        -MAYBE ITS JUST FIND A BETTER FONT
        -Try changing the way we do font scaling maybe

    - there is no transition for text decoration because there are only two states, underlined
    and not. Could try to implement fade-in underline a different way.
        -using opacity, can make another anchor tag that fades in while the other fades out
        -linear transition, that way the text density is always 100% but underline fades in
    - 


ADDRESSED
- Mobile and Tablet viewer slightly improved, mobile first design with bootstrap col-sm attribute
- Unsure that l and r columns were guaranteed same size, bootstrapped better so it will always be same size
