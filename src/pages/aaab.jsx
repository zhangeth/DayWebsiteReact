                            Olivia Rodrigo, age twenty, is a Filipina-American singer-songwriter who exploded onto the music scene after her role in the Disney+ series High School Musical: The Musical: The Series and her debut single “Driver’s License” launched her to fame. Written at the ripe age of seventeen, “Driver’s License” and her debut album Sour went on to win three Grammys. On September 8, 2023, Rodrigo released her sophomore album, Guts.

                        <p class="pv2 py-2">
                            The opening track of Guts is a song titled “all-american bitch”. It’s sonically a diametrically-opposed masterpiece: Rodrigo opens with light guitar strums and lightly singing the lyrics:
                        </p>
                        <h6 class="h6v4 pt-4" style={{textAlign:'center'}}>
                            “I am light as a feather and stiff as a board

                        <h6 class="h6v4 pt-2 pb-4" style={{textAlign:'center'}}>
                            pay attention to things that most people ignore”
                        </h6>
                        <p class="pv2 py-2">
                            As soon as the chorus hits, the strong guitars seem to shred right through your ears and into your brain as Rodrigo angrily almost yells:
                        </p>
                        <h6 class="h6v4 pt-4" style={{textAlign:'center'}}>

                            I’m a perfect all-American b*tch”

                        <p class="pv2 py-2">
                            Rodrigo does this for the entire song: she juxtaposes light and airy serenades from the verses about being docile, gentle, and classy —
                        </p>
                        <h6 class="h6v4 py-4" style={{textAlign:'center'}}>
                            “I got class and integrity just like a goddamn Kennedy, I swear”

                            — with grungy and barely-repressed, angry choruses that scathingly mock at the impossibility of being nineteen and a girl.

                        <p class="pv2 pt-4 pb-2">
                            While “all-american b*tch” certainly captures the rollercoaster-like, double-standard ridden experience of being a girl in today’s society, the track does so much more than just externalize all the rage of being nineteen.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pv2 py-2">
                            As an Asian American herself, Rodrigo perfectly captured not just what it’s like to be a young woman today, but what it feels like to be an Asian American woman.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pv2 py-2">
                            At the intersection of racism and misogyny lies the stereotypes and pressures that dictate AAPI women’s behaviors and identity.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pv2 py-2">
                            These stereotypes sway like a pendulum between a spectrum of docility and aggression — Asian women are depicted as either docile, obedient, and exotic (think how “yellow fever” was born), or overly-controlling, dominating, unemotional, and unappealing (think “tiger moms”).
                        </p>
                        <h6 class="h6v4 py-4" style={{textAlign:'center'}}>
                            “I am built like a mother and a total machine”
                        </h6>
                        <p class="pv2 py-2">
                            As Asian Americans, we are held to an impossible standard of achievement, humility, grace, and silence. We achieve, only to be belittled or mocked for being uninvolved and uninterested in American society.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pv2 py-2">
                            We challenge this reductionist view, only to be told we are not working hard enough and ungrateful for the opportunities we’ve been given. We attempt to break our culture of silence, only to be told to sit back down or go back to where we came from.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pv2 py-2">
                            The model minority myth is not only harmful for the APIDA community due to the drastically diverse nature of Asian Americans in the US (both in ethnicity, religion, and socioeconomic status), but also is used as a wedge and excuse to continue to oppress other BIPOC and marginalized communities.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pv2 py-2">
                            As Asian American women, we are told to be docile, to be brave, to be beautiful, to be deep, to be scholars, to be mothers — but somehow we can never be all of these things without being called inappropriate or ungrateful. And at the end of the day, still not American enough.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pv2 py-2">
                            So yes, that scream at the bridge is a cathartic moment for us all — Olivia is screaming for all of us who are tired of being just “grateful all the time.”
                        </p>
                        <p class="pv2 py-2">
                            “all-american b*tch” is a legitimization of the experiences of the Asian American woman, by reclaiming the “all-American” identity for a group that has been historically been made to feel perpetually not that — and reminded us that we are empowered lay claim to it.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pv2 py-2">
                            The track is a reminder and validation to all of us that we know our place and this is it: we are American enough, and we are undoubtedly
