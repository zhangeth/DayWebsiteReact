                    Korean culture has become more ubiquitous in the past few years as an ever-increasing number of people watch K-dramas, listen to K-Pop, eat Korean food, and add K-beauty products to their routines. This growth has been further demonstrated with the rise of K-culture events such as the K-Pop Festa at USC’s McCarthy Quad on September 23, 2022, in which USC became the first campus in America to ever host a K-Pop concert. This event was a testament to the ongoing propulsion of Asian culture into the global limelight.

                    <p class="pv2 py-2">
                    The event started with an intense K-Pop dance cover competition in which 12 nationwide dance teams (2 of which were from USC) competed for a spot in the next round, which will take place in Korea. Both the dance groups and the audience were diverse in composition, illustrating K-Pop’s wide reach and demographic. The passion that exuded from the performances highlights the great impact K-Pop has had on youth and dance as well as the willingness of current generations to learn about Asian culture. Although there was a subtle sense of competition, the overall support the groups and audience exchanged with each other shows the unified camaraderie that permeates throughout the K-Pop community.

                    One of the highly anticipated performers was the 7-member Korean rookie boy band Kingdom, which debuted in 2021 with their single “Excalibur.” The members, who performed after the competition concluded, were dressed in traditional clothing that not only suited the group’s regal theme but also showed another aspect of Korean culture to the audience. They performed multiple hits, ranging from the upbeat songs “Ascension”, “Black Crown”, and “Blinder” to the emotional ballads “The Song of Dann” and “Eternity.” Their performances showcased K-Pop’s vibrant fusion of music styles to both avid fans and people who have never listened to K-Pop before, making Asian culture more present.

                    The second highly anticipated headliner was singer and actress Kim Sejeong, known for being a part of the show Produce 101 and becoming a former member of girl groups I.O.I. and Gugudan. Sejeong has recently skyrocketed in popularity due to her portrayals of Do Ha-na and Shin Ha-ri in the K-dramas The Uncanny Counter and Business Proposal. At the event, she captivated the audience with her performances of “Flower Way”, “Skyline”, “Love, Maybe”, and “Let’s Go Home.” She also engaged in an interview where her bubbly personality shined. Sejeong talked about visiting Disneyland and being surprised by the number of people that recognized her as the female lead in Business Proposal, showing the sheer magnitude of the spread of Korean culture.

                    <p class="pv2 py-2">
                    This event was significant as no other college campus in America has hosted a K-Pop concert. It was inspiring for Asian-American students to see people of varying backgrounds come together to celebrate their interest in Korean culture. Signifying our society’s continuing evolution into becoming more accepting and inclusive of diverse cultures, this event will hopefully pave the path for other Asian cultures and minorities to spread the richness of their culture on a global scale.
