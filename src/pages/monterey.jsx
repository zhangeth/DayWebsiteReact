                        On a night meant to be full of joy and ushering in luck and fortune, Lunar New Year festivities in Monterey Park faced a devastating tragedy. According to the Los Angeles Police Department, a gunman opened fire on Saturday night and killed ten people, wounding ten more.

                    <p class="py-2">
                        As of now, details about the shooter are limited and not public. The gunman is still at large, and the second day of the Lunar New Year festival in Monterey Park has been canceled.

                        Monterey Park is a predominantly Asian American community, with two-thirds of the population identifying as such. The AAPI community also makes up more than half of Monterey Park’s neighboring city, Alhambra.

                        This shooting has left the Asian American community deeply saddened and angry. Lunar New Year is one of the most joyous occasions of the year for our community. On a day when we should be coming together to celebrate, many of us are spending it mourning instead.

                        DAY USC is devastated for the lives lost last night and are heartbroken for the families who were impacted and are grieving. We are also incredibly angry that violence against the Asian American community continues to persist. Our community has fought hard to shine a light on the tragedies and attacks against our people in the past few years, and this shooting happening on a day symbolic of family, safety, and celebration is equally shocking as it is appalling.
                    </p>
                    <p class="py-2">
                        With more details of the shooting to come, we urge you to check in on your Asian American friends, and continue to uplift APIDA voices and stories. We hope the media will report on this with accuracy, compassion, and conviction–it would be a disservice to do so otherwise. And finally, we encourage everyone to reflect on where this mass shooting fits into the bigger picture of public safety, gun violence, and the wellbeing of all marginalized communities who have been constantly and consistently fighting against such hate and violence.
