                        Ever since its launch in 1943, New York Fashion Week has evolved to keep up with the changing demands of its consumers. The latest change has been the official launch of the South Asian New York Fashion Week (SANYFW) to uplift fashion inspired by both traditional and modern South Asian cultures.

                        Featuring designers across the South Asian diaspora, the shows were categorized by streetwear, sustainability, menswear, traditional, bridal, and Indo-western styles. Featuring two headliners Nomi Ansari and Mayyur Girotra, along with 13 other upcoming design houses like Recover Season and Pali, SANYFW ran from September 8th through the 14th.
                        In addition to the runway shows, SANY also hosted a marketplace for a variety of small businesses and artisan vendors like Amaaya Jewelry, Verve & Vogue, and Sakhya.

                        Historically, NYFW has had overwhelmingly white designers. In the past few years, the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) has grappled to address the lack of diversity in its shows and designers. With the world becoming more socially conscious, coupled with the rise of race supremacy across the world, it is imperative for institutions to show that they are supporting people of all colors, shapes, and sizes. 
                        While there has been a definite increase in the number of Black designers at this year’s NYFW (more than 25% of the NYFW schedule), South Asians are often not extended the same support, even though 5.4 million people in the United States are of South Asian descent, according to South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT).

                        Founder and COO of SANYFW Shipra Sharma shares a vision of bringing a mission-driven, inclusivity-focused, and intentional South Asian fashion platform to the global market. After seeing South Asian fashion be discredited and culturally appropriated on a global platform, she was emboldened to show homegrown fashion at its core. She believes that “South Asian fashion is, in its truest form, a source of inspiration to designers around the globe.”
