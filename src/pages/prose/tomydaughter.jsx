You will live to enjoy the beauty of the frozen world, for you mean a great deal to Zuckerman and he will not harm you, ever. Winter will pass, the days will lengthen, the ice will melt in the pasture pond. The song sparrow will return and sing, the frogs will awake, the warm wind will blow again. All these sights and sounds and smells will be yours to enjoy, Wilbur — this lovely world, these precious days...”"

paragraph1[0] = "You were born into this world sleeping. Before you, I thought all newborn babies were ugly -- rat-like, wet, and frighteningly delicate. I thought that when all mothers exclaimed about how gorgeous their newborn babies were, they spoke from a cocktail of high emotions and hormones that would shield them from the reality of how disgustingly tiny and alien-like babies were. But when I saw you after my 24 hours of hard labor, you were, and still are, genuinely the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. The moment I held you, everything seemed to fall together. The past 30 years of my life seemed to focus on one, singular purpose -- to make you happy, to protect you to my dying breath."
paragraph1[1] = "You might wonder why I am writing this letter to you. I know you must have many questions, and I have very few answers. I’ll try my best to tell you everything that I have failed to tell you. My hope is that after all this, you understand what I have done and why I have done it. I think all parents’ greatest fear regarding their children is that one day, they will look at each other and realize that they see nothing but a stranger, that with each passing year, their child grows further and further away from them. Seeing you now, you seem like you’re miles away from me. I understand if you’ll be away from me forever. I just ask that you listen."

paragraph2[0] = "My favorite book throughout my life was Charlotte’s Web, and I named you Charlotte after the selfless spider who saved Wilbur’s life. It’s no surprise, then, that you grew up loving spiders. Do you remember how fond you were of spiders? As a kid, you hated when your father would viciously kill spiders hiding in the nooks and crannies of the house with the bottom of his slippers. His eyes would blaze red with bloody murder, veins popping out on his forehead so prominently they’d look like they were about to burst. You’d stop him with a hug from the back, begging him to spare their lives. Then, you swooped in with your bare hands and coaxed them onto your palms. “Look!” you exclaimed. “They’re so harmless!” With a bright smile, you rushed for the backyard and gently set them down in the grass. “Back to where you belong,” you’d exclaim with a smile. I’d crouch next to you, ruffling your hair, watching the spider disappear into the blades of grass. You’d be happily squatting, your hands pressed against your slightly tilted head, smiling from ear to ear. I’m not sure where you got that gentleness from. It definitely wasn’t from your father, who was callous and obsessed with his past glory as a Taekwondo gold medalist. And it definitely wasn’t from me, who has dirtied these hands too many times to count. "
paragraph2[1] = "In the past, you asked why dad was out of the picture. You learned to stop asking when I would never give you a real answer. Here’s my first answer to your many questions. Did you know, Charlotte, that female spiders are stronger and larger than male spiders? Did you know that they consume male spiders after mating? They eat them whole in order to give them the strength to survive to cultivate their children. To cultivate you. "

paragraph3[0] = "Sitting down at dinner with you recently feels like sitting in a hot stew. The temperature keeps escalating, and both of us cook without daring to say something that might ruin the delicate balance of peace between us. One wrong step, and it feels like the entire pot will burst and overflow. "
paragraph3[1] = "But even if there’s this tension between us, I still marvel to see how beautiful you’ve blossomed. Before me, you’re the perfect picture of a successful lawyer, eyes sharp and fierce like your father’s, and your hair pulled into a perfect curled jet black ponytail. Your suit is neatly and fastidiously pressed, with no hint of any dust lingering on the smooth fabric, and your tastefully added gold jewelry accents the golden brown of your eyes. You look regal. You look like you hate me. "
paragraph3[2] = "“Mother,” you say. “Tell me the truth. What really happened to my middle school teacher, Mr. Krapov?” "
paragraph3[3] = "I haven’t heard that name in years. Slowly, a faint memory bubbles up: Mr. Krapov, trembling; my hand, bloodied. "
paragraph3[4] = "I smile softly and reach out for your hand across the table. You pull it back instantly, repulsed, your soft skin crumpling into lines as you scowl at me. “What does it matter? Mr. Krapov was an asshole.” "
paragraph3[5] = "You uncross your legs and lean in, slamming your hands against the table. Every action feels deliberate; it feels that I’m stuck in a web, and you’re circling in for the kill. Your fingernails are a bright red. “Mom,” you state, voice sterile. “Back then I was too young to find it strange. Why did he die two weeks after I complained to you about him?” "
paragraph3[6] = "Slowly, I realize what you’re insinuating. A harsh, grating laugh comes crawling out of my throat."
paragraph3[7] = "“Charlotte, dearest, surely you aren’t implying what I think you’re implying?”" 
paragraph3[8] = "You raise only an eyebrow in response."
paragraph3[9] = "“I know you’re a criminal lawyer, but you can’t be going around thinking your mom is a criminal. Have all those terrible, violent cases been getting to your head?” “Mom.” Your voice has lost its emptiness. In replacement, a sharpness has emerged, a sliver blade shaped by rage."
paragraph3[10] = "“Tell me then -- why have all the people I have ever disliked died?”"

paragraph4[0] = "During your middle school years, specifically 7th grade, you came home crying one day, your eyes ringed with red and dried tears leaving streaks down your cheeks. “Sweetheart, what’s wrong?” I asked you, wiping the tears from your eyes. “Tell me. Your mommy is always here for you. Mommy will help you.” "
paragraph4[1] = "“My teacher is so mean to me,” you choked out between sobs. Your back trembled like a lone leaf during a storm, and I rubbed your back gently. Anger had started to build inside me -- I felt like a pan that had been cooking on a fire for hours. My head filled with fog, rage numbing all my senses except for one cold, familiar impulse. "
paragraph4[2] = "“What did he do to you, Char?” I murmured. I tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. “You can tell mommy anything.” "
paragraph4[3] = "“He humiliated me,” you replied softly, your voice still retaining a slight tremor. “He told me that my test score was so pathetic, I should just drop out of middle school. That father left us because I’m stupid.” "
paragraph4[4] = "“Is this the first time he’s said something like this?” I asked."
paragraph4[5] = "“Don’t get mad for not telling you earlier?” You looked up at me with big doe eyes, tears still glinting in the corners of your eyes. “For months. It’s why my grades have been declining this quarter. "
paragraph4[6] = "I listened carefully -- the best thing a parent can do for their child is to listen earnestly."
paragraph4[7] = "Later that night, I found Mr. Krapov’s house online after a couple Google searches. In my hand, the knife felt strangely weightless as I unlocked the window and sliced the screen door open. Mr. Krapov, a middle-aged man with graying hair and a mousy mustache, laid sideways across the couch, one leg dangling off the edge. One of his hands was dug into the bowl of popcorn that was balanced on the crest of his belly. A plaque sat on the coffee table in front of Mr. Krapov, reading Best Middle School Teacher of the Year! "
paragraph4[8] = "Pleasure surged through my body as I took the plaque. It was heavy in my hands, and I relished the heft of it as I smiled down upon Mr. Krapov’s peaceful face. The following action was almost automatic. The plaque was a blur in my eyes until it came down into the teacher’s skull, splitting it open with blood and guts."
paragraph4[9] = "“Oh, Mr. Krapov,” I cooed. “You really should have watched your mouth.” I lowered my right ear to the man’s chest, listening carefully. The thumps of his heart were weak, fluttering like a dying butterfly’s wings. Each wilting beat sounded like a symphony in my ears. It was a beautiful song, and I still relish the sound of his fluttering heartbeat until it was no more. I did it for you, my sweet Charlotte. I did it to maintain your happy life. Days later, the news broke. "
paragraph4[10] = "“Mom, Mr. Krapov is dead.” You and I are home again, going over the history homework he assigned on the communal desktop."
paragraph4[11] = "I pretended to act surprised. I thought of the plaque that sits up on the top shelf in the cardboard box of the basement, that still sits there to this day. "
paragraph4[12] = "“Oh, goodness. Do you know what happened?”"
paragraph4[13] = "“It’s undisclosed information,” you said. “But I heard rumors that he was murdered in his own home.”"
paragraph4[14] = "“I am so sorry, Char. That must have come as a shock to you.” I reached for you and grabbed your hand, rubbing circles on your palm. I thought of the way Mr. Krapov died -- pathetic and miserable, alone and surrounded by the guts of his own brain. He had looked awfully small and fragile when I had stared at his sleeping visage." 
paragraph4[15] = "You looked genuinely sad: your amber eyes glistened, and your lip wobbled. “Darling, he was horrible. Aren’t you glad he’ll stop being your teacher?” You glared at me, your eyes suddenly cold and icy. It’s a reaction I couldn’t fathom -- the same reaction I still can’t comprehend when you sat before me just now at dinner. Now, I think about the piles of motherhood books I read to prepare for your arrival and recall passages of teenage rebelliousness. Before, I thought it was a temporary rebellious phase, that your ungratefulness was a typical feature of adolescence. I thought that one day, you would come to understand why Mr. Krapov had to go and what I did for you to make him go away. You’re my daughter, after all. My hot-headed girl that shares my blood."
paragraph4[16] = "Growing up, I saw little hints that you might understand -- your penchant for Hammurabi’s laws, your obsession with punishment befitting the crime, your enthrallment with violence on the screen. When you were five, you were so enraged that a swarm of snails destroyed the plants you had painstakingly planted that you drowned all the snails you could find in a plastic water cup mixed with your father’s cigarette ashes. But instead of giving fully into impulses of violent revenge, you went the other direction into the law, relentlessly pursuing justice in the rigid system."
paragraph4[17] = "I guess I was too optimistic. My motherhood books always said that you can’t expect your children to be like you."


paragraph5[0] = "You still come to our next dinner. You sit down, looking more tired and gaunt than before. I’ve made some of your favorite food today, anticipating your visit: mapo tofu, chao nian gao, and liang pi."
paragraph5[1] = "You don’t touch your food at all. Instead, you absentmindedly move your fork around in the soup, breaking the tofu down into smaller and smaller pieces. "
paragraph5[2] = "Always the conversation starter, you break the silence. “What happened to Lucas Henderson, my school bully?”"
paragraph5[3] = "I think of the pink tongue, preserved in a jar, presented next to the plaque that says Best Middle School Teacher of the Year!"
paragraph5[4] = "“What happened to Brent Holland?” "
paragraph5[5] = "I think of that jackass partner of your law firm that sexually harassed you and refused to promote you when you rejected his advances, his hand mummified and propped on top of the jar with the pink tongue. I no longer want to lie, but I no longer want to tell you the truth if it hurts you. I did it for you would only break you, so instead, I smile gently and point at the food with my spoon. “Charlotte, eat your food. Your father would go rabid knowing that you weren’t eating such delicious Chinese food.”"
paragraph5[6] = "You glare at me and then back down at the food, returning to your hypnotic stirring of the soup. Suddenly, you stiffen. You’re suddenly still, as if paralyzed by venom. Slowly, you lift your head up to look at me. You look something like a deer caught in the headlights; your face is pale and white, as if blasted by headlights, and your eyes glitter like two large, fearful orbs. “What happened to dad, mom?”"
paragraph5[7] = "I think of a mother spider, alone in the center of its web, quivering from the full meal it had. “I did what had to be done."


paragraph6[0] = "I expect you’ve forgotten by now, which is just the way I want it to be. It’s why we don’t have any photos of your father or any mention of taekwondo around the house. I made sure he only came for me. I made sure that he would sink further into my sticky web before he could ever touch you."
paragraph6[1] = "I loved your father once, before he became a taekwondo gold medalist. Back when I knew him, he was tall and ruggedly handsome, with jet black hair and cat-like eyes. His eyes in particular were what drew me to him. They creased so perfectly, the corners swooping upwards, as if they were drawn in by a careful brush. It made it look like he was always thinking; my parents disapproved of him because it seemed like he was always scheming. But I loved him nevertheless. He once stood like a mountain, proud and confident, always aiming for the peak of his performance. "
paragraph6[2] = "When sparring with someone for the Pan-Asian Qualification tournament, he suffered a terrible injury -- a debilitating fall that not only tore his ACL, but also unlucky enough to give him a concussion. He could never compete competitively again. It was as if a switch had flipped within him, and the man I once knew could never return. He became unkind; yelling whenever the smallest thing displeased him, disappearing in the night for hours at a time to come back a slobbering drunk, throwing things at me when he got particularly upset. "
paragraph6[3] = "You were a quiet baby; you barely cried, and when you did, they were always during predictable intervals of time before your usual meals. One day, I left the house to buy groceries. When I came back, you were crying incessantly -- a high-shrieked wail that I’ve never heard from you. Hovering over you, shrouded in darkness in the shaded room, was your father and his fist in the air."
paragraph6[4] = "But I still forgave him after that, but that was the last chance I would ever give him. He could yell and punch me, scatter bruises around my body that would be hidden underneath my blouse, but as long as you were safe, it didn’t matter. He could come after me all he liked; what was untouchable was you, the jewel of my life, my very soul. "
paragraph6[5] = "When you were five, you began to take an interest in taekwondo, so your father began teaching you. He was inpatient; the mountain I knew him as was now as cruel as the peaks of Mt. Everest, and his eyes were dark and cloudy like pools of ink. He took you to taekwondo practice every morning on the weekends, and I would sit anxiously at home, unable to do anything until you came back to me safe and sound. "
paragraph6[6] = "One day, you came back with a bruise around your eye, flowering into vibrant blues and purples across your cheek. Father punched me, but it was an accident, you said. I was disappointing him. "
paragraph6[7] = "And, well. I’m a creature of habit. I’m sure you could guess what happened to him."

paragraph7[0] = "You haven’t come to this week’s dinner. I suspect that you’ve found some critical evidence that I didn’t clean away carefully enough, that the private investigator you probably hired has finally found my proof behind my dirty secrets, and you’ve been told to not come home to me. I don’t blame you, though once I thought we were cut from the same cloth. You chose to open up Pandora's box, and I choose to bear the punishment in your place."
paragraph7[1] = "I suppose I only have a few minutes left until the police start knocking on my door. And for you, I’ll let them find everything. I’ll let them find Mr. Krapov’s plaque, Lucas Henderson’s tongue, Brent Holland’s hand. Your father’s wedding band. They’re my gifts to you, so even if you grow to hate me, you’ll know of the magnitude of my sacrifice."
paragraph7[2] = "You never read Charlotte’s Web particularly carefully, so I doubt you’ll know this. Did you know, Charlotte, that after spider mothers give birth, they die? They spend all their energy and time on their eggs that they no longer have the energy to stay alive. "
paragraph7[3] = "You won’t find my body, I’ve made sure of it. No one will, in fact -- not even any fancy private investigator you could possibly hire. So live well for the life I’ve given you. Even if you want to reject me, you will always be my daughter."
