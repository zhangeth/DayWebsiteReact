                        Our relationship is complex. <br></br>
                        a towering wall stands between us <br></br>
                        and no matter how many times we cry out to each other, <br></br>
                        english slams into brick, <br></br>
                        korean collides with concrete <br></br>
                        and they never quite reach the other side. <br></br>
                        i face the mocking wall before me: <br></br>
                        korean characters flash in nonsensical patterns before my eyes, <br></br>
                        incoherent phrases and intonations ring in my ears, <br></br>
                        taunting me as i drown in guilt, isolation, shame, and anxiety.<br></br>                     
                    </p>
                    <p class="pv2 py-2">
                        Our relationship is complex.<br></br> 
                        but maybe not as complex as i thought!<br></br> 
                        ten-year-old me was <br></br> 
                        so transfixed on that daunting language barrier,<br></br> 
                        so blind to the cracks hiding in that seemingly impenetrable wall,<br></br> 
                        so deaf to the Love that squeezed through those crevices.<br></br> 
                        but now, if i shut my eyes, open my heart and focus,<br></br> 
                        i can hear my halmoni’s determined, never-ending affection<br></br> 
                        reaching me in whispers, wrapping me in Love<br></br> 
                        even though i’m standing on the other side of the wall.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pv2 py-2">
                        i don’t have to speak korean to know her Love.<br></br> 
                        i feel it in every embrace: <br></br> 
                        her strong hands firmly patting my back, her small frame enveloping<br></br> 
                        my own in such strength.<br></br> 
                        i see it in every encouraging smile:<br></br> 
                        the proud, adoring glow lighting up her eyes as she gazes at her<br></br> 
                        granddaughter.<br></br> 
                        i taste it in every mouth-watering meal she cooks:<br></br> 
                        her mandu stuffed with meat, vegetables and care, her tteokguk bursting<br></br> 
                        with flavor and warmth.<br></br> 
                        i hear it in every phone call:<br></br> 
                        audible kindness fills the gaps in her broken english and joy radiates<br></br> 
                        from her gentle laugh.<br></br> 
                        all along, this is how she was saying<br></br> 
                        “jessica, I Love You.”

                        Our relationship is complex.<br></br> 
                        yes, that battered wall still stands today <br></br> 
                        but it’s crumbling, crumbling, crumbling:<br></br> 
                        soft clay disintegrates in my outstretched fingers, fragmented rubble<br></br> 
                        piles at my feet.<br></br> 
                        18 years later, the barrier is finally tumbling down.<br></br> 
                        18 years later, i realized our relationship is characterized by Love:<br></br> 
                        the one language we do share<br></br> 
                        and the most powerful one of all.<br></br> 
                        it extends across generations and shatters mountains of stone<br></br> 
                        and it’s the one that will never fail my halmoni and me.
