paragraph0[0] = "Summers in Shanghai were always gloriously hot, but glorious nonetheless. Stepping foot into Pudong International Airport, I felt swallowed by discomfort, hating the way my tongue stumbled through Chinese or how the hot stickiness of the air seemed to cling to me like saran wrap. But it was always worth it. I loved watching the scenery change through the windows of the taxi as the opulence of the new parts of Shanghai gave way to older buildings and greenery. I loved hearing my parents chatting with the taxi driver in Shanghainese, a language they rarely got to use in America outside of our family, and grow ever more animated as they connected with speakers of a slowly dying dialect. Twelve years of consecutive visits, and my smile without fail always grew on my face as we passed the familiar red shopping complex and turned into your neighborhood. The familiar bumpiness of the roads, the old fading white apartment complexes, the tall green trees with birds hidden in the midst, the mosquito traps on street corners -- I knew it all and yet each visit felt like a new sensory experience. As we drove in, I’d always scan the ground to see if I recognized the same stray cats from last year, or the purple elderly playground to see if you were on one of the swinging leg machines that I still don’t know the name of. You never were, but it would have been funny to see you on one. "
paragraph0[1]= "The taxi would pull in front of your complex, and we would haul our luggage out onto the stone pavement, huffing and already drenched with sweat. Mother and I would stand, panting in front of the green gate where we could buzz for you to come to get us. Then there you were, excited and laughing, with a huge smile on your face. The smile lines around your eyes would crinkle up, and you’d throw your arms up. Something about you in these moments looked animated, almost Disney-like in the way happiness would spread through your limbs." 

paragraph1[0] = "You’d usher us in with gusto, a feast already prepared on the dining table. “I’ve bought new indoor slippers for you all!” you’d say. In the fridge, there were always rows and rows of newly bought Yakult and other Chinese yogurt milk drinks for me. Now that I’m older and more perceptive, I’ve realized that you personally never cared for them. You had walked down the grocery aisle you otherwise would have never taken a detour in with me in mind."
paragraph1[1] = "Exhaustion and fatigue slipped away seeing you and grandma again. I loved sliding my feet across the dark brown parquet mosaic floors and hearing the blender churn for your favorite fruit smoothies. The guest room bed with a bug net over it, a luxury you never gave yourself. The blue tiled bathroom walls. The random books, newspapers, and knickknacks on the counters. The glass table and the old brown couches that you probably had for 20+ years, covered with a soft pink sheet."
paragraph1[2] = <div>And the yard, the beautiful yard -- where <em>wu gui,</em> or Turtle, once resided, until he ran away. We never knew how he did it -- your working theory was that he did it shoving his body through the vertical gaps of the green metal yard door. <em>How is that possible?</em> I remember asking. <em>He’s a turtle, how is he going to maneuver himself through that small gap?</em> You described one time with conviction where you witnessed <em>wu gui</em> only utilizing the legs on his right side to crawl through gaps around the yard. You refused to entertain any other theory. Before he ran away, I remember watching you feed him in a water basin. You were methodical about it, as you were with everything pertaining to the yard, but did everything with such an ease it was hard to tell that the basin was actually heavier than it looked. With only a small grimace lining your face, you would smoothly release the small bag of fish you bought at the market and <em>wu gui</em> would suddenly become a vicious predator, snapping at the fish until nothing but red was left, ballooning through the clear water like a jellyfish. When he was let loose in the yard after his feeding times, I remember trying to find him among the various potted plants around the yard. He hid well. I never found him, but you always found him, familiar with his favorite hidden resting spots.</div>
paragraph1[3] = <div>What I remember the best is the canopy of grapes that grew overhead and the way we would pick them together when they got ripe. <em>Homegrown grapes are the best,</em> you would say. <em>And the neighborhood birds sure know it!</em> You were vigilant about defending your grapes, picking them as fast as you could and setting up nets diligently. Every chance you got, you’d be offering grapes to mom or me, as if the grapes would be stolen by the crows straight from our hands if we didn’t shovel them down our throats fast enough. "</div>
paragraph1[4] = <div>A month ago, or maybe a bit more, we got a call from my uncle. We were already worried, as you had mentioned feeling ill, and stopped responding to phone calls and Facetimes for two days. On the first day with no news from you, my mother called my uncle, begging him to check on you. <em>Can you just do this one thing?</em> Every word was enunciated sharply, anger and panic seeping out on the edges. <em>Just check if he’s okay! He’s been sick for awhile now -- he caught something, it could be COVID!</em> Ever the selfish man, he failed to do so. On the second day, he finally went to check on him. He delivered the news robotically. My mom cried, her face buried in her hands, shaking silently. I’d never seen her cry before, except for when grandma died, and we saw her face before they closed her coffin to be cremated. Her face was so white and unreal.</div>
paragraph1[5] = "Things and details are getting harder to recall now; sensations and images are mixed with my recreation of what I think happened, and what I want to have happened. There are memories that you have of our time together that I don’t remember because I was too small and my memory is too poor. And now all those memories that you remembered that I will never know of are gone forever because you are gone too. Sorting through these memories is like trying to hold onto mist. I think I remember things you said and did, but the brain is a tricky thing when it comes to time. It could have happened; maybe it never happened. I am forgetting our time together in the summers and it scares me. My mom always said I am careless; she says I pass through time as if every moment is forgotten as it happens. She is right — if I cared more back then, maybe I could remember more. Maybe when I experienced an amazing moment, I could have made a note to remember it or write it down. The act of doing this now is much too late."
paragraph1[6] = <div>My mom recently confided to me that in the last year, you stopped saying, “I’m sure I can live to 100!”, something you’ve been proudly proclaiming as long as I remember. Instead, you began telling her, “I’m so old and useless. There’s no use in someone as old as me being alive.” You’d given up your dreams of living for a century. I wish she’d told me this earlier so I could have told you. <em>Don’t value your life so little like that. I need you. We need you. Please stay until I can at least see you in person one more time. Please stay so you can see my wedding, and my children, like you promised.</em></div>
paragraph1[7] = "I don’t know what happened when you forgot the meaningness of your life. Did we forget to tell you we loved you enough? Did I forget to say 我爱你 too many times on Facetime? What went wrong, for you to no longer believe in the value of your life? I realize too late that I’m filled with regrets of things I could have done better. I could have texted you more often, sent you pictures of college life at USC, FaceTimed you every week. I could have sat down with you and sketched together, practiced English with you to supplement the English recorder lessons that you had bought off a sleazy vendor, or helped you in the kitchen more often. I had lived life always assuming that you would be there -- one click away on Facetime, a home that never changed across the sea. "
paragraph1[8] = "My mother and I, for a small period of time, built legos to pass the time. We actually got the call from my useless uncle, your good-for-nothing son, in the middle of building a New Year’s lucky cat at 11:30 PM on New Year’s Eve. My mom blamed herself, I blamed myself, I blamed my selfish uncle, we went to bed numb. I remember the next morning, coming down the stairs to see my mother tinkling with the good luck cat still, trying to finish it. As if she could somehow save you, and the new year, if she could finish the cat. It was calico, like one of the unfriendly stray cats in your neighborhood."
paragraph1[9] = "I have some questions I want to ask you, questions that you can never answer now. Did we fail you, being hundreds of thousands of miles away from you? Why didn’t you call, when you felt yourself weakening? Why were you so goddamn stubborn, always telling us you were fine and healthy when you weren’t? But I figure I know the answers, and you died like you wanted. Stubborn and proud. With strong-headed confidence to believe you could make it through by yourself, selflessness to the end with your desire not to bother others, and serenity to accept death. I bet you’re laughing wherever you are, happy to be with grandma at last, and excited to bike to your heart’s content. So I’ll choke these questions down and hope that in your passing, you knew we loved you. That the house without you is quiet and empty, and the world without you has lost one of the best people that I have ever known. I think of the yard that has surely died without your golden touch, the white T-shirts and wife beaters blowing aimlessly on the clothing lines, the bicycle that’s probably rusting on the fence you locked it to, the markets that have lost one more enthusiastic customer, the park paths that have lost the footsteps that briskly strolled down them. No more newsman flat cap and blue jeans paired with a jolly laugh. All gone."
paragraph1[10] = "My mom and dad increased their visits to campus to visit me in the months after your passing. On one of the visits, we went to Sun Nong Dan, and we got the expensive Koh Galbi Jim, or the braised oxtail/short rib/back rib dish, where you could order cheese to go on top and a waiter would come and blowtorch the cheese in front of you. I sat there, chatting with my parents and a quiet happiness slowly seeping through my bones, and suddenly wondered if it was okay to be this happy when you were gone. We would never be able to share a meal like this with you again; we would never have reunion feasts or pop juicy grapes in our mouths together in the hot summer. It suddenly felt so wrong to be happy: to be foolishly in awe at the blowtorch melting the cheese down so smoothly, or to be so comfortable in this act of normalcy of eating lunch with my parents that I had never realized was a lucky privilege to have until now. "
paragraph1[11] = "But I was happy. Sitting there with my family, I could forget that 6000 miles across the sea, the house was empty and you were gone."

fill[0] = "They were images of you, dead, in your getup they put you in before they sent you to be cremated. And you were dead, but you were smiling, as if you hadn’t suffered at all, as if you were happy to go. Your usual, big smile -- the one you’d always greet me with on Facetime. The phone suddenly felt like a brick in my hand, and the remnants of my happy mood came crumbling down around me. I could feel the tears pricking my eyes, but tried to hold them back so I could speak without wobbling my voice. "

paragraph2[0] = "My eyes were fixated on your smile, a smile that seemed so big and radiant as if you were still alive. Something was blurring the vision of your photo. “Why does he have such a big smile? Did the crematoriums put that smile on him?”"
paragraph2[1] = <div>My mom whispered, “No, when they discovered his body, they found him like that.” My voice was definitely wobbling now. “Why does he look so happy? Do you think he was happy when he passed?” I thought of you, all alone in that house, COVID slowly killing you with no one to care for you in your last and most painful breaths. <em>Happy?</em> I couldn’t fathom it. “Was he happy to go?”</div>

paragraph3[0] = " "
paragraph3[1] = "Grief is a funny thing. The first few days it feels very physical, as if it’s a parasitic root stuck in your heart and crawling up your throat to rest perversely on your tongue. After a while, it fades into white noise that quietly buzzes at the back of every waking minute. You forget you hear it until a small trigger might draw the weed back out your throat to blossom. Death and life are “mutually dependent, co-arising modalities of a rhythmic, cyclical patterning,” according to Zhuang Zhou, a Daoist philosopher. Death is a partner to life, a force which passes through all that is alive. Daoists don’t seek to eliminate grief; they believe death reveals life, and embrace it as a natural alignment with the nature of the universe. I understand what Zhuang Zhou is saying. Sometimes I think I internalize it. In the middle of assignments, I’ll suddenly realize I haven’t thought about my grandfather at all that entire day, how grief feels like a friend I look kindly upon. And some days I feel like an early Confucian who commits to three years of mourning, except to me, it feels like the mourning will never end."
paragraph3[2] = "My mom flew back to China sometime in February. She’s already been there for three months, and will stay another three more more, alone inside the walls where we all once laughed together with nothing but memories to keep her company. She went to see the house one last time, see what there is to keep, see what there is to toss, and prepare the house to be sold to its next family who will create their own new stories within those walls. On Facetime, I can see tiny glimpses of the house that now seems so unfamiliar and familiar at the same time. Some things, like the oddly shaped clock on the wall, the dark green curtains in the living room, and the smooth dark brown chairs of the dining table are still there, but everything else is not -- the messy collections of newspapers under the table, the incense burning on top of the refrigerator, the stacks of books and other small trinkets you collected throughout your storied life. I cried after the call, seeing how so much had changed, how the house that you had made your home for over thirty years had been reduced to nothing that recalled your presence. What is the point of ever returning to China, now that you’ve passed? What is the point of ever stepping foot in Shanghai when I can’t ever wake up in the morning to the sound of you juicing your fruit smoothie and joining you in your morning exercises? The house is all I have left of you, a house I haven’t been able to see in years, and when it’s sold, there will be none of you left. "
paragraph3[3] = "So I write. I write to try to remember anything I can. I fear it’s much too late -- that I’ve already forgotten the most important parts, and will continue to forget the most important parts, until there’s nothing left. Even if I can never see the house again, it will live here now, somehow. What I say here will never capture the full glory of your life and what you mean to me. It really is too little, too late. But I’ll try. Sometimes I think I’ve come to terms with losing China as a home forever. Little drawings tucked into the corners of your notebooks, the hallway in which we paraded up and down parodying a train, the TV where we watched Chinese variety shows together, the counter in which you listened to English lessons, the fridge where you placed your MP3 player so you could do your morning exercises; all gone soon, where the new inhabitants will make their own memories to replace the ones secretly landmarked inside your house. But to me, no matter what new family moves in, the old peeling white walls and the brown wooden floors of this beautiful house will forever be ours."
