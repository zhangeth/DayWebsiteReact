                    Queen Elizabeth II died on September 8, 2022, marking the end of a 70-year reign. As a symbol of the British monarchy, her legacy cannot be separated from that of the colonial empire. This is seen most obviously through the precious stones that she wore, many of which were taken from former colonies. Since her death, there have been renewed calls for the jewels to be returned to their rightful owners.

                    As the Queen lay in state, the Imperial State Crown, the Sovereign’s Sceptre with Cross, and the Sovereign’s Orb rested upon her coffin. These three items are sacred objects that are central to the Crown Jewels collection and part of the regalia used for her coronation ceremony in 1953. Both the sceptre and the crown are set with pieces cut from the Cullinan diamond, known to be the largest gem-quality diamond that has ever been found. The Sovereign’s Sceptre holds the 530-carat Cullinan I, while the Imperial State Crown is adorned with the 317-carat Cullinan II.
