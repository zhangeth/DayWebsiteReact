                    Queen Elizabeth II died on September 8, 2022, marking the end of a 70-year reign. As a symbol of the British monarchy, her legacy cannot be separated from that of the colonial empire. This is seen most obviously through the precious stones that she wore, many of which were taken from former colonies. Since her death, there have been renewed calls for the jewels to be returned to their rightful owners.

                    As the Queen lay in state, the Imperial State Crown, the Sovereign’s Sceptre with Cross, and the Sovereign’s Orb rested upon her coffin. These three items are sacred objects that are central to the Crown Jewels collection and part of the regalia used for her coronation ceremony in 1953. Both the sceptre and the crown are set with pieces cut from the Cullinan diamond, known to be the largest gem-quality diamond that has ever been found. The Sovereign’s Sceptre holds the 530-carat Cullinan I, while the Imperial State Crown is adorned with the 317-carat Cullinan II.

                    The Cullinan I and Cullinan II are also known respectively as the Great Star of Africa and the Second Star of Africa. The original stone was first found in 1905 in a private mine located in South Africa’s old Transvaal province. The owner of the mine was South African diamond magnate Thomas Cullinan, who the gemstone is also named after. Two years after it was discovered, the Transvaal government, which was under British rule, purchased the diamond and presented it to King Edward VII. While claimed to have been given as a gift, it could arguably be considered an illegitimate transaction performed under colonial authority.

                    The Imperial State Crown is also set with various other gemstones that are believed to be of Asian origin including territories encompassed by present-day Afghanistan, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, and Kashmir. These gemstones include the Black Prince’s Ruby, the St. Edward’s Sapphire, and the Stuart Sapphire.

                    Another crown in the collection, the Queen Mother’s Crown also holds a very controversial gemstone. The 105-carat Koh-i-Noor diamond is the centerpiece of this crown and has long been embroiled in an ownership dispute. While the British monarchy says that the jewel was obtained legally, four countries, namely India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran, claim that it was stolen and belongs to them.

                    <p class="py-2">
                    The Koh-i-Noor went through a tumultuous history – first known to have adorned Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan’s jeweled Peacock Throne. It was looted by Persian ruler Nader Shah when he invaded in 1739 and would remain outside of India for 70 years, changing owners repeatedly in the territory that would later become modern-day Afghanistan. Eventually, Sikh ruler Ranjit Singh obtained it, and the diamond became a desirable symbol of power. After the British annexed Punjab in 1849, they forced his descendant, 11-year-old Duleep Singh, to sign a treaty that gave away both the gemstone and all claim to rulership.
